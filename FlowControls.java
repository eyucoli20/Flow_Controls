/*
Create a program that does the following:

Takes 2 numbers as input. The difference between the numbers canâ€™t be any less than 200.
if the difference is less than 200 then the program will have no output and will end.
The program should sum up the numbers that are even and also divisible by 4.
Then the program should sum up the numbers that are even and also divisible by 8.
Then the program should sum up the numbers that are not even and and not divisible by 5.
These values should all be displayed at the end of the program.
You must use all three kinds of loops and a switch statement.

Be sure to properly document your code with comments!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
